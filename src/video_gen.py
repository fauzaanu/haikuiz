"""This starts the work on quizpal video generations.

As twitter is running now this can be the content we are looking for. but we also need this for tiktok.
Then again twitter does work the same way as tiktok and elon has signaled that such a feed may appear very soon.
So we will use the tiktok format for video generations. This wouldnt be bad for telegram as well as we can post them as stories.
Looks like tiktok has set a trend.

Furthermore, telegram beta version has added the ability to add links to stories. this would indeed be very cool if implemented in time.
